# ChinookWebApplication
A web application with Chinook Database and the use of MVC model without admin/user sides.
We used Visual Studio for this Project and Entity Framework.
It was a University Project for "Data Bases".

Firstly, we had to create some T-SQL queries in our data base in SQL Server Management Studio.
Then, we added those queries as stored procedures and connected the data base with the web application.
Finally, we made View and Controllers automatically, as well as, the application shows results of stored procedures for specific input (specified by us).
